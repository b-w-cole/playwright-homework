# Playwright Homework
This is a collection of files built for achieving the [Bondar Academy "SDET with Playwright"](https://www.bondaracademy.com/course/sdet-with-playwright) course.  The assignment surrounds an imaginary veterinary website and includes a full test suite using a variety of techniques.

```Note: The tests point to a test site and require credentials to log in.```

Tests are written in Typescript and follow the Page-Object-Model design pattern.

In here, you will find examples of:

* Playwright tests (under "tests")
  * UI Testing
  * API Testing
    * [Working with API](https://github.com/b-w-cole/playwright-homework/blob/master/tests/workingWithAPI.spec.ts)
    * [Performing API Request](https://github.com/b-w-cole/playwright-homework/blob/master/tests/performingApiRequest.spec.ts)
* Page objects (under "pages")
  * [PageManager](https://github.com/b-w-cole/playwright-homework/blob/master/pages/pageManager.ts) (manages instantiation of all pages)
* Test Fixtures
  * [Test Options](https://github.com/b-w-cole/playwright-homework/blob/master/tests/test-options.ts)
  * [Test with Fixture](https://github.com/b-w-cole/playwright-homework/blob/master/tests/testWithFixture.spec.ts)
* Docker integration
